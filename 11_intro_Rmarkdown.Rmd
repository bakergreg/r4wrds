## Rmarkdown: Knitting Things Together

This entire course website is built using Rmarkdown files. Dissertations, papers, reports, and interactive documents are all very possible using Rmarkdown. While it would be impossible to show you how to do all of these things, the good news is while Rmarkdown is highly customizable, there are only a few key components to learn. We'll go over some of the main pieces, demonstrate some fun tricks that are made easy using Rmarkdown, and provide a bunch of great resources to help you learn more!

```{r rmarkdownwiz, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='(ref:AHrmdplot)'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "rmarkdown_wizards.png"))

```

### Reproducible

Depending on the tasks you are faced with, analysis is rarely something that happens a single time. We are constantly faced with tasks (sometimes small, sometimes large) that have repetitive information, or repetitive steps to complete. Making this process more reproducible by using reusable tools (*e.g. `{dplyr}`*) and skills (**R/Rmarkdown!**) means you save your future self time and energy, as well as make it easier to communicate and share your work.

### Combine <span style="color:#473C8B">Text</span> + `Code` + <span style="color:#D02090">*Figures*</span>

Rmarkdown documents may initially seem scary and a bit overwhelming, but once we understand there are basically 3 main components to learn, things get easier. There are many flavors and options to customize each of these, but let's cover the basics. 

## Rmarkdown Components

There are really *three* main parts of an Rmarkdown document (**yaml**, **text**, and **code**). The first of the three is required no matter what. The other two, **text** and **`code`** are more flexible and are not necessarily required.

RStudio provides an excellent Rmarkdown editor, and even better, the most recent version of this software provides a nice **Visual Editor** mode which makes it even easier to learn the basics of Markdown and Rmarkdown. Let's create a new `Rmarkdown` document in RStudio.

 - *__File > New File > R Markdown__*
 
We should see something like this:

```{r newRmdmenu, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='New R Markdown file'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "new_rmarkdown.png"))

```

Use the default settings for HTML (we can always change it later), and click **OK**.

Once the Rmarkdown document appears and opens in RStudio, we should see something like this:

```{r newRmddoc, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='The blank R Markdown template'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "new_rmarkdown_doc.png"))

```

If you look at the top right of the window, there's a small "A" shaped compass^[ [Drafting compasses are really cool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drawing_tool))]. If you click on that icon, the R Markdown document will render into something that is visually more appealing and essentially will look much more like a word processor might.

```{r visualbutton, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='140%'}

include_graphics(here("images/visual_editor_bar.png"))

```

```{r RmdVisual, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Visual markdown editor'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "rmarkdown_visual_editor.png"))

```

<aside> You can toggle the outline/table of contents on and off with the button immediately to the left of the "A" shaped compass. 
</aside>

### `yaml` header

**`yaml`** stands for `yet another markup language`. Save that for a trivia question in the future. Every Rmarkdown document uses a `yaml` header (the bits between the `---` marks) at the top of the document to tell your computer how R should knit your document together (stitch all the different parts together into a single seamless document).

There are many possible options here and they can depend on the type of document we want to create, but typically the key pieces are:

 - **`title`**: Name of our document
 - **`output`**: what we end up *knitting* our R markdown into (e.g., `.pdf`, `.html`, `.docx`). See the [RStudio R Markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) for more details on different format options.
 
<aside>
Note, spacing and indentation matters in `yaml`. If we'd like to specify additional options for a specific output, we need to add more lines and indent the argument we want to add.
</aside>

Let's focus on making an `.html` file, and add some parameters about the table of contents. We can add `toc: true` and `toc_float: true` to our yaml so it looks like this:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
---
```

Now each section and subsection of our document will appear in the table of contents. How do we make a section or subsection? Read on!

### Body Text

The body of our document is typically text written in Markdown^[more on the simple markup language [Markdown here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)]. Markdown is a simple text language that helps make it very easy to just sit down and type without worrying about formatting, and it works across many different operating systems and applications. There are a few basic formatting options to do things like make font bold, italicized, add numbered or bulleted lists, or add section headers. To learn more, while in RStudio, go to the menu and locate Help at the top of the screen. Under **Help** > **Markdown Quick Reference** you'll find a handy "cheatsheet" to help learn these options. There are many additional RStudio cheatsheets for many topics [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), and a specific pdf on using R Markdown is available as a pdf [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).

For example, to add a figure using Markdown, we can use the following:

```
![alternate text](happy_face.png)
```

<aside>
We'll talk more about how to customize image sizes and add captions within RMarkdown later in this module.

### `code` chunks

The third and final component of an R Markdown document is what makes it **R** Markdown. The inclusion of **`code`**! What's great is while the default is typically `R` code, there are quite a few additional code language options that can be stitched together. Look for the little `+C` icon in green at the top of your R Markdown, or go to **Code** > **Insert Chunk**. The keyboard shortcut to do this is **`Ctrl + Alt + i`**.

<aside>

```{r code-chunk-langs, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width='80%'}

include_graphics(here("images", "code_chunk_languages.png"))
```

</aside>

Let's go ahead and create a new `R` code chunk and look at some of the chunk options.

<!-- see this post for making code chunks verbatim: https://yihui.org/en/2017/11/knitr-verbatim-code-chunk/
-->

````
`r ''````{r}
# my empty code chunk!
```
````

There are many code chunk options we can use. Put your cursor after the **`{r,`** and hit tab. There are tons! If you want to learn more, check the [R Markdown reference guide](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf). The key options that we want to know:

 - **`echo`**: TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, whatever code we put in the chunk will be displayed when we knit the document.
 - **`eval`**: TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, the code inside the chunk will be evaluated or run.
 - **`include`**: TRUE or FALSE. If FALSE, the code is still run, but the results won't be displayed and neither will the code.^[Code that has been evaluated in one chunk can be referred to or used in subsequent chunks. So you can load objects at the start of your document and use them throughout the entire document]
 - **`fig.cap`**: A quoted character string, adds captions to figures from code outputs. One caption per chunk.
 - **`out.width/out.height`**: A quoted percentage, i.e., "100%". This controls the size of the image being output from a given code chunk. Very easy and effective for changing graphic output sizes.

## Knit Early and Often

One thing that makes writing in R Markdown fun is the ability to get instant feedback. Clicking the **Knit** button when a section of your document has been updated will (re)-generate the document. We can change the default location the outputs appear by changing the options via the little gear wheel to the right of the knit button. Look for "**_Preview in Viewer Pane_** and select it. From that point on, every time you click knit, most outputs should appear in the **Viewer** pane of RStudio.

Knitting frequently can be tedious if you have a large document with lots of figures or visuals. However, it's a great way to learn, and also to make sure things are rendering correctly and successfully.

## Customizing Visuals

There's lots of great visualization materials out there, but there are a few helpful tips to keep in mind when using images or graphics in your R Markdown documents. While the default Markdown option does permit adding images with the `![](image.png)` syntax, it doesn't permit as much fine control. 

If we use a handy function from the `{knitr}` package, we can have more more concise control over the size and placement of an image without having to learn a lot of special code. For example, we can use either a local file path, or a url! In addition we can add some arguments that help us specify the size of the image, using the `out.width` or `out.height` parameters. Finally, we can add a caption with `fig.cap`. Note, here we want to hide the code and just show the image, so we use `echo=FALSE`.

<aside> 
By using `fig.cap` in the code chunk, the figure caption numbers will be automagically assigned and updated each time you knit
</aside>

````
`r ''````{r rivphoto, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap="A tranquil river (photo: RP)"}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "river_peek.JPG"))

```
````

```{r river-image, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap="A tranquil river (photo: RP)"}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "river_peek.JPG"))

```




## Tables

Sharing data in tables is a common need for reporting, summary, and analysis. There are a number of packages in R that may be helpful for making tables. This list is not exhaustive, and is meant to just show a few options that may be useful.

 - [{DT}](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/): Great for interactive and dynamic html based tables 
 - {kable} & [{kableExtra}](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/): Highly customizable static or dynamic tables
 - [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/): Very customizable static or dynamic tables

Let's load some data we can play with. We'll use some existing datasets that come with packages you already have installed. The {dplyr} package comes with a number of different datasets, as do many R packages^[To figure out what datasets are available, try `data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))`]. We'll use the *`storms`* dataset since it's large (+10,000 observations), and our `nwis_sites` from the American River which we created in a previous module.

```{r data-for-tables, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

# large dataset: dplyr::storms
storms <- dplyr::storms

# sites
nwis_sites <- read_csv(here("data", "nwis_sites_american_river.csv"))


```

For large unwieldy tables that you may want to just be able to quickly search or explore, the `{DT}` package is great, especially for `.html` documents. Let's make a table of the `storms` data. A nice feature of the `datatable()` is we can search and filter our table interactively. 

```{r tables-dt, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(DT)

storms %>% 
  slice(1:200) %>% # take first 100 rows
  datatable() # that's it!

```

For a quick and easy static table, the `kable()` function from `{knitr}` is great. We can simply pass a dataframe to the function and we get a table! For more fancy options, we can use the functions from the `{kableExtra}` package. 

```{r tables-kable1}

library(knitr)
storms %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% # take first 10 rows
  kable()

```

Here's a slightly fancier option using `{kableExtra}`. See the great [vignette](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html) for more details.

```{r tables-kableExtra}

library(kableExtra)

storms %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% # take first 10 rows
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)

```


For nicely formatted tables and lots of control, the `{gt}` package is good. It does take a little more wrangling to get things formatted, but there's great documentation for this package as well.

```{r tables-gt, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

library(gt)
tab1 <- nwis_sites %>% select(-sourceName) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% # get just first 10 rows 
  gt()

tab2 <- tab1 %>%
  cols_label(identifier = "NWIS ID",
             comid = "COMID",
             X = "Longitude",
             Y = "Latitude") %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "NWIS Sites on the American River",
    subtitle = "Downstream of Nimbus, Sacramento County") %>% 
  fmt_number(
    columns = vars(identifier, comid),
    decimals = 0, use_seps = FALSE)
tab2

```


## Interactive Maps

And as you've seen from previous modules, we can also add maps! This is also a really nice way to share lots of information. We can only add `{mapview}` maps if we are using an html-based output, but they work well in R Markdown.

Let's plot our NWIS Stations from the American River that we already loaded above. First we need to convert these data to {sf}. Let's show code that does that. Remember to use `eval=TRUE` and `echo=TRUE`! One additional tip is to *label your R code chunks*. This helps us troubleshoot when things are not knitting properly, and helps keep things organized. 

<aside> Code chunk labels show up in the outline, so making them informative is good. However, we can only use characters and "-" in a code chunk label!
</aside>

````
`r ''````{r make-nwis-sf, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

library(sf)
# make nwis_sites spatial by converting to sf
nwis_sites_sf <- st_as_sf(nwis_sites, coords=c("X", "Y"), remove=FALSE, crs=4326)

```
````

Next we can make our map with `mapview()`. Note, there can be a minor rendering issue with `{mapview}`. Adding `fgb=FALSE` seems to address this! Note, here we are going to hide our code so that we only show the results!

````
`r ''````{r make-nwis-mapview, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

library(mapview)
mapviewOptions(fgb=FALSE)

mapview(nwis_sites_sf, col.regions="cyan4", layer="NWIS Sites")

```
````


```{r mapview, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

library(sf)
library(mapview)
mapviewOptions(fgb=FALSE)

nwis_sites_sf <- st_as_sf(nwis_sites, coords=c("X", "Y"), remove=FALSE, crs=4326)

mapview(nwis_sites_sf, col.regions="cyan4", layer="NWIS Sites")

```
