## Rmarkdown: Knitting Things Together

This entire course website is built using Rmarkdown files. Dissertations, papers, reports, and interactive documents are all very possible using Rmarkdown. While it would be impossible to show you how to do all of these things, the good news is while Rmarkdown is highly customizable, there are only a few key components to learn. We'll go over some of the main pieces, demonstrate some fun tricks that are made easy using Rmarkdown, and provide a bunch of great resources to help you learn more!

```{r rmarkdownwiz, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='(ref:AHrmdplot)'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "rmarkdown_wizards.png"))

```

### Reproducible

Depending on the tasks you are faced with, analysis is rarely something that happens a single time. We are constantly faced with tasks (sometimes small, sometimes large) that have repetitive information, or repetitive steps to complete. Making this process more reproducible by using reusable tools (*e.g. `{dplyr}`*) and skills (**R/Rmarkdown!**) means you save your future self time and energy, as well as make it easier to communicate and share your work.

```{r reproducible, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='(ref:AHreproducible)'}

```

### Combine Code + Text + Figures (& more!)

Rmarkdown documents may initially seem scary and a bit overwhelming, but once we understand there are really only 3 main components, it's all just various flavors and renditions from there. Let's get started!

## Rmarkdown Components

There are really *three* main parts of an Rmarkdown document. The first of the three is required no matter what. The other two **text** and **`code`** are more flexible and are *not* necessarily required.

### `yaml` header

`yaml` stands for `yet another markup language`. You will never need to know anything beyond that, so save that for a trivia question in the future. But every Rmarkdown document uses a `yaml` header (the bits between the 3 `---` marks) to tell your computer how R should knit your document together (stitch all the different parts together into a single seamless document).

RStudio provides an excellent Rmarkdown editor, and even better, the most recent version of this software provides a nice **Visual Editor** mode which makes it even easier to learn the basics of Markdown and Rmarkdown. Let's create a new `Rmarkdown` document in RStudio.

 - *__File > New File > R Markdown__*
 
We should see something like this:

```{r newRmdmenu, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='New R Markdown file'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "new_rmarkdown.png"))

```

Use the default settings for HTML (we can always change it later), and click **OK**.

Once the Rmarkdown document appears and opens in RStudio, we should see something like this:

```{r newRmddoc, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='The blank R Markdown template'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "new_rmarkdown_doc.png"))

```


### Body Text

### `code` chunks

### Data

```{r}
# CalEnviroscreen Data
calenviro <- read_csv(here("data", "calenviroscreen/ces3results_data.csv"))

# remember to use a relative path!
df_all <- read_rds(here("data","sacramento_gw_data_w_calenviro.rds"))
#save(df_all, file="data/sacramento_gw_data_w_calenviro.rda") # compression is better

```
