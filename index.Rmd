**Course Modules**

In this course, we will practice:

* [Data and file management: understanding RProjects and file paths](00_install_R.html)
* Understand and identify different data formats (i.e., wide, long, tidy) and data structures (i.e., vectors, dataframes, lists) 
* Import and export various water resources data
* Strategies for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Strategies for troubleshooting (reading documentation, intro to reprex)
* Transforming data with {`dplyr`}
* Data visualization with {`ggplot2`}
* Data presentation and communication with {`RMarkdown`}

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. This workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of R. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.shp`) used in analysis, and provide resources for additional learning.

## Workshop Overview

We will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.



## Software requirements

Please setup a computer/laptop with the latest version of RStudio and R installed.  Download the compressed [data](https://github.com/ucd-cws/CABW2020_R_training/raw/main/data/datazip.zip) folder and make sure it is accessible on your computer.  The [setup instructions](01_setup_R.html) will guide you through the rest of the process.  Take note of the required R packages that you must also download and install.  Please contact the instructors with any questions or issues related to setup.
