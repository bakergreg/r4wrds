[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. This workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of R. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.shp`) used in analysis, and provide resources for additional learning.

<br>

## Workshop Overview

We will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.
