**Learning objectives**

-   Extend functional programming skills to automate `.Rmd` reports  
-   Understand the available types of reports provided by `{rmarkdown}`  
:::

Analyses typically lead to figures, tables, and a narrative interpreting these information. The [`{rmarkdown}`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package provides `R` users with a standardized approach for turning `R` analyses into reports, documents, presentations, dashboards, and websites. In this module, we assume familiarity with `{rmarkdown}`, and extend the previous modules on iteration, functional programming, and reproducible workflows to demonstrate how to iterate over reports.

<aside>
If needed, review the [introduction to `{rmarkdown}`](../intro/m_intro_Rmarkdown.html).
