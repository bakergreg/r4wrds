As you accumulate raw data, write code, and generate results, things can get messy if you don’t stick to good programming naming and organization habits. In this module we’ll cover how to keep your projects organized and consistent, which ultimately will make projects more reproducible and keep your workflow more efficient and fun.\nA development environment is the set of tools you use to process data and the toolshed. R and packages are your tools, and an RProject is your toolshed.\n\nREVIEW\n\nAlthough this is an intermediate level course, we will revisit introductory material on “Project Management” because no matter your skill level in R, strategic project management remains fundamental. Subsequent modules in this course assume familiarity with {here}, .Rprojects, naming conventions, and general best practices.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing core introductory topics, we will discuss .RProfile and .Renviron files and when to use them. To review core best practices we recommend particular familiarity with the following concepts:\nFilenaming\nRelative filepaths and the {here} package\nBest practices for project organization\n.RProfile\nIf you have user- or project-level code that needs to be run every time you start up R, customizing your .RProfile can streamline this operation.\nThe .RProfile file is an actual (hidden) file that is automatically sourced (run) as R code when you open an R session. A .RProfile file can live in the project root directory, or the user’s home directory, although only one .RProfile can be loaded per R session or RProject. If a project-level .Rprofile exists, it supersedes the user-level .Rprofile.\nYou can also “show hidden files” (instructions for Mac and PC) and edit .RProfile in a text editor. You can also do so in R with file.edit(\"~/.RProfile\").\nGlobal (user-level) .Rprofile\nThe easiest and most consistent way to edit your .RProfile file across operating systems is with the {usethis} package. Run usethis::edit_r_profile() to open your user-level (or global) .RProfile. This is the default .Rprofile that will be used for any and all projects unless you have a local (project-level) .Rprofile.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\n\n\nLocal (project-level) .Rprofile\nWe can create or edit a local or project-level .RProfile with the scope argument inside the edit_r_profile function. Remember, a project-level .RProfile will supersede the global .Rprofile.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile(scope = \"project\")\n\n\n\nUsing .Rprofile\nTo illustrate how .RProfile works, let’s do something cool and useless. We’ll write a short program that greets us with a random inspirational quote, and then we’ll put in .RProfile so it runs whenever we start up R.\nThe {cowsay} package is a fun way to print text animal art.\n\n\ncowsay::say(what = \"hello world!\", by = \"cow\")\n\n\n\n ----- \nhello world! \n ------ \n    \\   ^__^ \n     \\  (oo)\\ ________ \n        (__)\\         )\\ /\\ \n             ||------w|\n             ||      ||\n\nLet’s randomize the animal displayed and make the message it says one of the motivational quotes found at this Github repo, copy and paste the code into our .RProfile, and restart R.\n\n\nlibrary(cowsay) # animals!\nlibrary(glue)   # pasting things together\n\n# get vector of all animals\nanimals <- names(cowsay::animals)\n\n# get pieces to make link\nrepo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\ncsv <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\n\n# get dataframe of inspirational quotes\nquotes  <- readr::read_csv(glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\"))  \n\n# make full quote\nquotes$full_quote  <- glue(\"{quotes$Quote} - {quotes$Author}\")\n\n# now use it!\ncowsay::say(sample(quotes$full_quote, 1), by = sample(animals, 1))\n\n\n\n ----- \nYou can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions. - Naguib Mahfouz \n ------ \n    \\   \n     \\  \n      \\\n       \\   _,\n      -==<' `\n          ) /\n         / (_.\n        |  ,-,`\\\n         \\\\   \\ \\\n          `\\,  \\ \\\n           ||\\  \\`|,\n jgs      _|| `=`-'\n         ~~`~`\n\nrm(animals, quotes) # remove the objects we just created\n\n\n\n.Renviron\nSometimes you need to store sensitive information, like API Keys, Database passwords, data storage paths, or general variables used across all scripts. We don’t want to accidentally share these information, accidentally push them to Github, or copy and paste them over and over again from script to script. We also might want to build a codebase that relies on a few variables that another user can set in their own system in a way that works for them. Environmental variables are the way to address all of these concerns.\nEnvironmental variables are objects that store character strings. They are accessible from within R upon startup. To view all environmental variables, use Sys.getenv(). You can also pull out one environmental variable at a time by passing in its name, for instance:\n\n\nSys.getenv(\"USER\")\n\n\n[1] \"richpauloo\"\n\nYou can set your own environmental variables which are stored in another hidden file called .Renviron (this is the Python analog of .env). Keep in mind, .Renviron files typically contain lists of environmental variables that look similar to R code but it is actually not running R code…so don’t put R code in your .Renviron file! If we need to run R code when starting up R, we use .RProfile.\nTo illustrate the use of .Renviron, we run usethis::edit_r_environ(), add the environmental variable ANIMAL = \"cat\", save, and restart R.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n\n\n\nWe can access our environmental variable as follows (remember you need to restart R for changes to take effect, try Session > Restart R):\n\n\nSys.getenv(\"ANIMAL\")\n\n\n\nWe can use our environmental variable, for instance, in a function.\n\n\ninspire_me <- function(animal){\n\n  # get pieces to make link\n  repo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\n  csv  <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\n  \n  # silently read dataframe\n  suppressMessages(\n    quotes  <- readr::read_csv(\n      glue::glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\")\n    )  \n  )\n  \n  # paste together the full quote\n  quotes$full_quote  <- paste0(quotes$Quote, \" -\", quotes$Author)\n  \n  # make a user-specified animal say the quote\n  cowsay::say(sample(quotes$full_quote, 1), by = animal)\n\n}\n\n# have the environmental variable say a quote\ninspire_me(Sys.getenv(\"ANIMAL\"))\n\n\n\nAlthough it may not appear powerful in this trivial example, when a project grows substantially large and complex, or when managing multiple sensitive passwords and access tokens, environmental variables are a standard approach that are widely used.\nImportant note, both these files .Renviron and .Rprofile need to end with a blank newline at the end. If this isn’t present, the last line of the file is ignored, and there isn’t a message or error associated with this. The usethis functions typically take care of this for you, but be aware of it just in case!\n\nPause and think\n\nIn the example function above, we might notice that reading in a url from a csv every time we run inspire_me() is a lot of unnecessary overhead. Where else might we be able to read that csv in automatically when R starts up, so that it’s available for our inspire_me() function, and that we only need to read it once?\n\n\n\nClick for Answers!\n\nWe can move read step of the csv into a project-level RProfile, so it’s available to the project where we need this csv, but not to any general R session we may open outside of the project.\n.RProfile\n\n\n# get pieces to make link\nrepo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\ncsv  <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\n\n# silently read dataframe\nsuppressMessages(\n  quotes  <- readr::read_csv(\n    glue::glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\")\n  )  \n)\n\n# paste together the full quote\nquotes$full_quote  <- paste0(quotes$Quote, \" -\", quotes$Author)\n\n\n\nModified function\n\n\ninspire_me <- function(animal){\n\n  # make a user-specified animal say the quote\n  cowsay::say(sample(quotes$full_quote, 1), by = animal)\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nStrategies to organize projects/code\nBest practices for writing code across languages typically recommend package imports and function definitions at the top of a script, followed by code. For example, a script may look like this:\n\n\n# import packages\nlibrary(package_1)\nlibrary(package_2)\n\n# define functions\nmy_first_function <- function(){\n  print(\"hello\")\n}\n\nmy_second_function <- function(){\n  print(\"world\")\n}\n\n# run code/functions\nmy_first_function()\nmy_second_function()\n\n\n\nThese approaches work well when scripts are relatively simple, but as a project grows large and complex, it’s best practice to move functions into another script or set of scripts, and break up your workflow into discrete steps.\nFor instance, although the inspire_me() function above is relatively simple, we can pretend that the read, transform, and print steps carried out in the function were themselves long functions in part of a much more complex, real-world workflow. Imagine we created a script called functions.R that contained the following code. Don’t worry if you haven’t seen purrr::walk() before. We’ll cover this in a later module on iteration, and all you need to know about it now is that it “walks” over each input and applies a function. In this case, we apply the require() function to a vector of package names to load them.\n\nNotice that all functions start with f_. This prefix makes it easy to read in a script and takes advantage of auto-complete.\n\n\n# list packages in a vector and load them all\npkgs <- c(\"readr\", \"cowsay\")\npurrr::walk(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\n# read quotes from a url\nf_read_data <- function(url){\n  suppressMessages(\n    quotes  <- read_csv(url)  \n  )\n  return(quotes)\n}\n\n# paste the quote to the author\nf_preprocess_data <- function(d){\n  d$full_quote  <- paste0(d$Quote, \" -\", d$Author)\n  return(d)\n}\n\n# print a random animal and a random quote\nf_inspire_me <- function(d){\n  animals <- names(animals)\n  say(sample(d$full_quote, 1), by = sample(animals, 1))\n}\n\n\n\nWe can call this script using source() to load or import these functions into our environment where they are available for use, just as we load a library.\n\n\nsource(here(\"functions.R\"))\n\n\n\nAbstracting Functions from Code\nHowever, this is hardly a satisfying solution because in a real project, our pretend functions above may grow quite large, and we will likely add more and more functions. Eventually, a single script may hold them all, and something like functions.R may become many hundreds of lines long, making it difficult to sift through, debug, or add new lines of code. A better organizational approach which makes things easier to maintain over time is to move all our functions to a directory /functions, and store them all as separate files named after their function name:\n\nA good rule of thumb to follow is to try and keep scripts less than 150 lines in length. When scripts approach this length, they become difficult to keep track of, and there were likely missed opportunities to refactor the script into separate functions and modules.\nSave as /functions/f_read_data.R\n\n\n# read quotes from a url\nf_read_data <- function(url){\n  suppressMessages(\n    quotes  <- read_csv(url)\n  )\n  return(quotes)\n}\n\n\n\nSave as /functions/f_preprocess_data.R\n\n\n# paste the quote to the author\nf_preprocess_data <- function(d){\n  d$full_quote  <- paste0(d$Quote, \" -\", d$Author)\n  return(d)\n}\n\n\n\nSave as /functions/f_inspire_me.R\n\n\n# print a random animal and a random quote\nf_inspire_me <- function(d){\n  animals <- names(animals)\n  say(sample(d$full_quote, 1), by = sample(animals, 1))\n}\n\n\n\nThe functions folder in the root project directory should now look like this:\n\n\n\nNow in our /code directory, we create a script, 01_control.R to source our functions and use them. Be sure to restart R to clear your environment before sourcing this control script so we know we are working from a clean slate.\nSave as /code/01_control.R and run.\n\n\n# packages needed for this script\npkgs <- c(\"readr\", \"cowsay\", \"here\", \"tidyverse\", \"glue\")\npurrr::walk(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\n# silently source all functions using the purrr::walk function\nwalk(list.files(here(\"functions\"), full.names = TRUE), ~source(.x))\n\n# define the url where quotes are located\n# get pieces to make link\nrepo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\ncsv <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\nurl <- glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\")  \n\n# use all of our functions\nf_read_data(url) %>% \n  f_preprocess_data() %>% \n  f_inspire_me()\n\n\n\n ----- \nWho we are never changes. Who we think we are does. -Mary Almanac \n ------ \n    \\   \n     \\\n     .-.\n    (o o)\n    | O \\\n     \\   \\\n      `~~~' [nosig]\n  \n\nsource() is the key to chaining together many scripts. In the example above, we were able to abstract functions into a separate folder which makes keeping track of them much easier than if they cluttered our control script.\n\nIt’s also a good rule of thumb to keep each line of code less than 75 characters long to ease readability.\n\nLearn more\n\nSeparating all functions into standalone scripts is not a revolutionary idea – in fact, this is precisely how R packages are written! For example, see the {dplyr} github repo’s /R folder which contains all dplyr functions in one directory. When you call library(dplyr) you’re essentially sourcing all of these functions into your environment.\n\n\nIf project management and reproducible data pipelines are interesting to you, check out the {targets} R package. A similar framework for Shiny Apps exists called {golem}, which also includes {usethis}-like commands that streamline common chores in Shiny App development.\n\n\n{renv}\nWe use {here} because we expect that whoever else opens your code on their machine is likely to have a different project root path, and {here} ensures your code is portable between different computers with different root project paths (e.g., ~/Documents/Github/myproject versus C:\\Users\\louis\\Documents\\myproject).\nDevelopment environments are similar. When we work in R – or any programming language for that matter – we use a snapshot of package versions based on when we downloaded and installed them [e.g. with install.packages()]. You can check the version of the installed packages loaded into your current environment with sessionInfo().\n\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\nR version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)\nPlatform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Catalina 10.15.6\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib\nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods  \n[7] base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] forcats_0.5.1   stringr_1.4.0   dplyr_1.0.4     purrr_0.3.4    \n [5] tidyr_1.1.2     tibble_3.1.0    tidyverse_1.3.0 here_0.1       \n [9] readr_1.4.0     glue_1.4.2      cowsay_0.8.0    knitr_1.30     \n[13] ggplot2_3.3.3  \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] tidyselect_1.1.0  xfun_0.22         haven_2.3.1      \n [4] colorspace_2.0-0  vctrs_0.3.7       generics_0.1.0   \n [7] htmltools_0.5.1.1 usethis_2.0.0     yaml_2.2.1       \n[10] utf8_1.2.1        rlang_0.4.10      gridtext_0.1.4   \n[13] pillar_1.5.1      withr_2.4.1       DBI_1.1.1        \n[16] dbplyr_2.1.0      readxl_1.3.1      modelr_0.1.8     \n[19] fortunes_1.5-4    lifecycle_1.0.0   cellranger_1.1.0 \n[22] munsell_0.5.0     gtable_0.3.0      rvest_0.3.6      \n[25] evaluate_0.14     curl_4.3          fansi_0.4.2      \n[28] broom_0.7.0       Rcpp_1.0.6        scales_1.1.1     \n[31] backports_1.1.10  jsonlite_1.7.2    fs_1.5.0         \n[34] rmsfact_0.0.3     distill_1.2       hms_1.0.0        \n[37] png_0.1-7         digest_0.6.27     stringi_1.5.3    \n[40] grid_4.0.2        rprojroot_1.3-2   cli_2.4.0        \n[43] tools_4.0.2       magrittr_2.0.1    crayon_1.4.1     \n[46] pkgconfig_2.0.3   downlit_0.2.1     ellipsis_0.3.1   \n[49] xml2_1.3.2        reprex_0.3.0      lubridate_1.7.9.2\n[52] httr_1.4.2        assertthat_0.2.1  rmarkdown_2.7    \n[55] rstudioapi_0.11   R6_2.5.0          ggtext_0.1.1     \n[58] compiler_4.0.2   \n\nThe version number is the string of numbers listed after a package name and underscore.\nSimilarly, you can use installed.packages() to view information on all of your installed packages.\nWhen packages change between versions, changes are typically designed to fix bugs or improve performance, but sometimes, they can break code. Thus, collaborative work on a project may be challenged by people working on the same code but with different versions of packages.\n\nEven the version of R itself changes, although base R changes very slowly and the R Core Team tries to make new versions of R backwards-compatible to not break scripts written before potentially breaking changes.\nThe solution to this problem is for everyone to use the same versions of packages (and R), which is to say that collaborators should use the same development environment. This is a common concept across programming languages.\n{renv} manages your package environment and makes it easy to share it with others by creating and curating a “lock” file (renv.lock) in the root project directory. When starting a project, create the file with renv::init(), install packages as you go along, and update the lockfile with renv::snapshot(). When a collaborator opens your project (for example, after cloning it from Github), all they need to do is open the .RProj file and {renv} will automatically set up the development environment captured in the lock file.\n\nThe renv.lock file is a JSON file with information on the version of R and the versions of all packages used by the project.\nIf you find yourself needing to share important analyses, perhaps that run on a production server, you should look into {renv}. For most day-to-day data science that you don’t plan on sharing or working collaboratively on, it may be unnecessary.\n\n\nPrevious module: Introduction Next module: Git\n\n\n\n",

In R, major versions are released infrequently (i.e., 3.0.0 was released in April 2013 and 4.0.0 was released in April 2020), but minor versions are released more regularly (4.0.4 was released in February 2021 and 4.0.5 was released in March 2021).\nAt minimum it’s advisable to maintain and update to the most recent major version of R, as these often contain important security/programming changes. Depending on your workflow and package needs, it’s good practice to keep the most recent minor version as well, though it’s not uncommon to maintain multiple minor versions of R if your analyses or workflows depend on specific versions of a package.\nCheck your    Version\nAn easy and quick way to check what version of R you have and the most recent available version is first to open R, type R.version, hit enter, and see what you get:\n\n\nR.version\n\n\n               _                           \nplatform       x86_64-apple-darwin17.0     \narch           x86_64                      \nos             darwin17.0                  \nsystem         x86_64, darwin17.0          \nstatus                                     \nmajor          4                           \nminor          0.2                         \nyear           2020                        \nmonth          06                          \nday            22                          \nsvn rev        78730                       \nlanguage       R                           \nversion.string R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)\nnickname       Taking Off Again            \n\nThis command will return information about the R version your system is using, as well as some information specific to your operating system (os).\nNext, visit the R CRAN website to see what the most recent version is. If you haven’t updated recently, go ahead and grab the most recent R version for your system and install it.\nWhen you update a major version of R, your personal library of packages will no longer work, and you will need to reinstall all of your packages. There are a few tools you can use to do this like . This work to stay up-to-date happens fairly infrequently.\nCheck/Update  \nWe can check our version of RStudio by going to the toolbar at the top of your RStudio window and clicking Help > Check for Updates. If you have the most recent version, there will be a message box letting you know as much. If not, RStudio will direct you to their webpage to download the most recent version.\nWhile it isn’t always necessary to update to the most recent version of R, there’s no reason not to always use the most recent stable version of RStudio. It will generally include the best features and up-to-date fixes.\nUpdating R Packages\nAs we use R more regularly for different tasks, it’s common to accumulate many R packages in our . Every package is maintained and updated on a different schedule than R and RStudio, and so as new functions and features are written, or bugs are fixed, packages will be updated intermittently. Some package maintainers do this regularly, others may do it sporadically. Either way, we will typically need to update packages semi-regularly.\nFiles associated with installed R packages are located at .libPaths(). View installed packages with list.files(.libPaths()).\nThere are several methods of updating your R packages. If updating via RStudio, go to the toolbar at the top and select Tools > Check for Package Updates.... Depending on how many packages you’ve installed, and how recently you updated things, a window will appear saying either All packages up-to-date! or something that looks more like this:\nAs a rule of thumb, whenever updating your R version, it’s best to update/install your R packages too!\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Package update window\n\n\n\nWe can choose to Select All and update everything at once, or selectively update things.\nAfter we click Install Updates we may typically also see a message like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Restart R\n\n\n\nYou can choose to cancel, but it’s fine to click Yes and proceed. Sometimes we will also get something in the Console that will ask the following:\n\nDo you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)\n\nSome packages require this, so generally it’s okay to type Yes and hit enter to proceed. At this point we can wait and let R/RStudio update things for us. Depending on how many packages are involved, this can take a few minutes. Importantly, when it’s all said and done, make sure there weren’t errors or issues with packages that didn’t get installed. We can use Tools > Check for Package Updates... again and see what packages remain, or if we get a message saying all packages are up-to-date.\nBest Practices for Updating\nWe recommend the following approach to updating R packages (check out the great rstats.wtf chapter on this topic and more):\nUpdate packages frequently (weekly)\nUpdate R quarterly (or at least check)\nFor complete reproducibility for a project check out the {renv} package\nDon’t copy packages over between R versions–start clean and fresh\nUpdating packages can be irksome, but it’s typically for the best. We advise updating your packages frequently if you regularly use R (e.g;, a weekly checks and updates to packages). If you want to be sure you have the exact package version for future use and reproducibility, the {renv} may be a great solution for an analysis or report, but may not be necessary if your aren’t using or working on a specific project/analysis. {renv} keeps a record of your R packages within an RProject down to the exact version number when you originally loaded these packages, and allows you to update this record as your project evolves over time.\nRead more about {renv} in the project management module.\nOverall, treat R and R packages as something that will be highly functional with minimal but regular maintenance, like a vehicle that needs new tires or an oil change once in a while. This will keep things running smoothly over the long-term.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Success over time! (Artwork by @allison_horst)\n\n\n\n\nSee a list of previous versions here.↩︎\n",

Version control is a framework and process to keep track of changes made to a document, data, or code with the added bonus that you can revert to any previous change or point in time and you can work in parallel with multiple people on the same material. In this module, we will practice version control with git, which is perhaps the most common version control system available today.\nThe important difference between using a tool like git and Github versus cloud-based services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Docs) which are in a way, version control systems, is the ability to control exactly what changes and/or files get “versioned”. These versions are snapshots of your work with unique identifiers along with a short commit message, which allows us to restore these changes at any point in time. Thus, git offers much finer control over specific changes by specific users; this makes version control a very powerful tool (as well as a computer lifesaver when things go awry!).\nWhat is the difference between git and Github?\ngit is a version control program that is installed on your computer with associated commands we use to interact with version controlled files.\nGithub is a website that interfaces with git and allows us to store/access/share our files as repositories1.\nThere is a rich and complex set of tools and functionality with git and Github, but in this module, we’ll focus on the basics and link to more material.\nUsing version control\nSome folks may just use version control as another way to backup their work2, but version control really shines when working on a collaborative project. For example, many are familiar with the situation below:\nFigure from http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif\nThe comic above shows a single thesis document, but really the situation isn’t any different than a big data analysis project. A common series of steps that are generally taken by multiple people, may include:\nDownload/gather data\nClean/transform data\nAnalyze and visualize data\nProduce a front facing product or report\nMany of these tasks (or subtasks) may overlap or depends on one another. Complex collaborative projects require forethought in how to set things up so everyone can seamlessly stitch their contribution into the overall fabric of a project without holding up the process for other team members.\nWith version control, if changes you make break things, it’s easy to revert or get back to an earlier working version using the commit timeline, because we have access to the history of our changes.\n\nPause and Discuss!\n\nIf you had 10 people to work on a big project with steps outlined above, how would you approach it? How would you break out these pieces or subtasks? How would you track progress?\n\n\n\nThis module will cover version control with git, including the basic commands, but it’s important to remember:\n\nUnderstanding and learning how to approach, setup, and implement collaborative projects with version control are just as important as learning git commands\n\nThus, successful version control is not just about effectively using tools like git, but also developing skills to organize projects, collaborate with others, and implement version control so it’s useful (not just another way to back things up…see below).\nLearn to leverage the power of git for things other than just a backup! (Figure from https://xkcd.com/1597/)\n\n\n\nLearning git through a project\nSometimes the best way to learn is to walk through a real-world example. Let’s walk through a simplified example of a common set of tasks a team may face using R and learning git along the way.\nLet’s imagine we have a team of 3 folks, Jo, Mo, and Main. Each has a unique skill set, and each knows how to use R and git. The team is tasked with downloading and visualizing flow data for a specific river gage to provide status report updates on a monthly basis, which are used for various regulatory actions (i.e., how much water is available for diversion, how flows relate to period of record averages, etc).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example team and workflow.\n\n\n\nLet’s get this team started on their! First we need to make sure everything is setup and installed.\nSetup git locally\nWe highly recommend Jenny Bryan & Jim Hester’s happygitwithr website because it covers everything (and more) that you may encounter when using git with R. In particular, please take a moment to check/update your git installation and configure Github. The following links will help with this:\nInstall Git\nIntroduce yourself to Git\nThe {usethis} package is an excellent option to help you get things setup within R, like this:\n\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\n# use your actual git user name and email!\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"yoda\", user.email = \"yoda2021@example.org\")\n\n\n\nRemember, we only need to do this once!3\nCreate a Repository\nThere are several ways to create repositories on Github and with RStudio4. We recommend the Github first option as it’s easiest to intialize and manage.\nTo begin, go to Github.com and login. From there, let’s create a new repository!\n\nChallenge\n\nPlease take a moment and create a new repository on Github following the happygitwithr.com instructions.\nName the repository water-is-life\nCheck the Add a README file box at the bottom\nMake this a public repository\n\nClick for Answers!\n\nHopefully you see something like this before you click the green Create Repository button.\n\n\n\nAnd then afterwards, a screen like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe last piece to this is getting this repository which is currently in the “cloud” to a local copy on your computer. This is called cloning. To clone the repository to your computer, we need to do the following:\nCopy the repository address. Make sure you’ve clicked HTTPS and the link in the box starts with https://. Copy that link to your clipboard.\n\n\n\nNow open RStudio and navigate to File > New Project > Version Control > Git\nIn the Repository URL box, paste the link in, and hit Tab. The Project directory Name should automagically fill with the name of the repository. Go ahead and put this where you want it to live locally5 and hit Create Project. Open in new session is optional, but allows you to keep existing projects open.\n\n\n\nGreat! We should now have an RStudio project that is version controlled with git, and there is a local copy we can work with on our computer.\nCollaborative Github Settings\nSince we are working on a collaborative project, we need to make sure our collaborators have access to make changes to our repository. So, if Main created the repository, they would need to add fellow collaborators to the repository. Let’s do that now:\nGo to Github.com and login\nNavigate to your repository water-is-life\nClick on the Settings tab in the upper right corner\nYou can view and clone (copy) any public Github repository. However, you can only commit changes if you are the owner, or have been added as a collaborator (more on this later).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Click on the Settings tab in the upper right corner to add collaborators.\n\n\n\nClick on Manage Access on the side bar on the left (you may need to enter your password or authentication again)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Then click on Manage Access.\n\n\n\nClick on Invite Collaborator and enter the username or email you want to add!\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Invite collaborators by email or username!\n\n\n\nBranches & Conflicts\nOften when teaching git, we start with the basic commands. However, it’s important to consider one of the more powerful parts of using git is the ability to use branches. Branches, or branching, in git, is a way for multiple folks to work on the same repository independently, and a standardized way to integrate those changes back into the repository. Every repository typically starts with one single main branch. This is like the trunk of the tree, or the main train track. We can create additional branches off of this track, and if we want to merge them back in to make them available for our collaborators, we use something called a pull request. This is essentially a way to double check if there will be any conflicts between the work in the branch and the work in the main branch6, and it also provides a way to document and review any changes. If a pull request does not create merge conflicts (don’t worry about this now, we will cover it later) and if a collaborator on the repository approves the pull request, then the branch is “pulled” (or merged) into the main branch, and then typically deleted (since the branch has served its purpose, and the changes in it are now reflected in the main branch).\nEven if you are the only person working in a repo, it’s a good habit to use branches because if you realize the branch/work you are doing is a dead end, you can always delete a branch and return to the main branch to pick things up where you last left off.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of multiple branches in a project splitting off the main branch\n\n\n\nCreate a branch\nIn our example we want to make sure we keep our main branch clean and up-to-date with changes we are happy with…all other work will go through a branch, pull request, review, and merge process to minimize conflicts or duplication of work.\nJo is a wizard at grabbing the data we want to work with and saving it in an organized way. She’s cloned the repository to her computer, and the first thing she wants to do is create a fresh branch to work off of, so her changes can be reviewed before being merged into the main branch.\nWe can create a branch in RStudio in one of two ways:\nTools > Terminal > New Terminal and look for the Terminal tab in RStudio. Click on it, and at the prompt, type git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME.\nUsing the Git tab in RStudio and clicking on the New Branch button, type in the branch name, make sure the Remote is set to origin and click Create!\nLet’s create a new branch called jo_download_data. Ideally, each team member will do the same, and each of these branches comes from the main branch, which is the main trunk or “clean” version of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Jo creates a new branch from main to write a data download script in R.\n\n\n\nDownload Data: add, commit, push\nJo’s task is to download the data. Because this is a task that will need to happen regularly, she writes a function to download the specific river discharge data to an organized set of folders. She runs the function to get the most recent data, and saves it locally on her version of the repository!\nAs she works, the general process she follows is:\nadd: Do some work, add some files, scripts, etc. To version control these changes, we need to stage or add that work so it can be versioned by git. We do this with git add <my_file> or check the Staged buttons in the RStudio git panel.\ncommit: Add a commit message that is succinct but descriptive (i.e., added water data files). These are the messages you’ll be able to go back to if you want to travel back in time and see a different version of something…so be kind to your future self and add something helpful.\npush: Finally, when we’re ready to send locally commited changes up the cloud, we push this up to the Github remote cloud repository!\nRemember, you can commit as frequently as you like, and push at the end of the day, or push every time you commit. The timestamp identifier is added with a commit message, not with the push.\n\nYou Try!\n\nTake the following function and:\nMake a new folder in your project called code, save as a script called 01_download_data.R\nstage it (either through the Git tab, or via git add),\ncommit (add a message!),\npush to the jo_download_data branch\n\n\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(dataRetrieval)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n# make a function to download data, defaults to current date for end\n\n# function: dates as \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\nget_daily_flow <- function(gage_no){\n\n  # create folder to save data\n  fs::dir_create(\"data_raw\")\n\n  # set parameters to download data\n  siteNo <- gage_no # The USGS gage number\n  pCode <- \"00060\" # 00060 is discharge parameter code\n\n  # get NWIS daily data: CURRENT YEAR\n  dat <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = siteNo,\n                    parameterCd = pCode)\n  # add water year\n  dat <- addWaterYear(dat)\n  # rename the columns\n  dat <- renameNWISColumns(dat)\n\n  # save out\n  write_csv(dat,\n            file =\n              glue(\"data_raw/nfa_updated_{Sys.Date()}.csv\"))\n}\n\n# RUN with:\n#siteNo <- \"11427000\"# NF American River\n# get_daily_flow(siteNo)\n\n\n\n\nAnswers!\n\nOnce we’ve made our script and saved it in the code folder, we should see something like this in our Git tab… notice the change when the box is checked.\n\n\n\nNext we want to commit and add a message. Note when we first click the Commit button, we’ll see this screen:\n\n\n\nWhen we enter a commit message and click Commit, we’ll end up with this, which tells us our commit worked…but it’s still only local! Note we’ll have a message saying our branch is\n\nahead of origin/jo_download_data by 1 commit.\n\nThat’s ok, it just means we still need to push our changes up to the remote branch.\n\n\n\nThe final step is to push our changes up to the cloud. Click Push and you should get message back like this. This means things worked…a final check would be go to Github and make sure the file is online!\n\n\n\n\nThink of every commit you make as a train station. The more commits you make (and the more descriptive they are) the easier it will be to get around…particularly because your train can travel back in time!\nPull Requests\nThe next step in this version control odyssey is to get Jo’s work from the jo_download_data branch into the main branch. Here we use a Pull Request. This is a way to review the changes, check for any conflicts (if for instance, folks were working on the same file), and then Merge these changes into the main branch. Then we can delete the jo_download_data branch, create another one to work on the next task, and so on.\nHere’s what we might see on Github if we visited our water-is-life repository after we pushed our changes up. First, we will hopefully see an option to make a pull request because Github recognizes there are changes from another branch that aren’t in the main branch. We want to click the Compare and pull request button.\n\n\n\nNext we have an option to add some additional descriptions, comments, about what this pull request (PR) is doing, and why. We can tag a reviewer (collaborator on the Github repo), and add labels, milestones, etc. These are all helpful for keeping track of what’s done and what’s not.\n\n\n\nAfter we click the green Create pull request button, we should see something that looks like the following. Important! We ideally will see a green checkmark with a message \"This branch has no conflicts with the base branch, which means, our main branch can easily merge this new work in!\nmerge conflicts are not something to be worried about, they happen, and there are a number of ways to resolve them. A good resource and walk through using Github is here, or with command line here.\n\n\n\nExiting vim: if you end up in a text editor and aren’t sure how to exit, you may be in vim. It is the default editor for many systems and programs. To exit without saving changes, hit Esc, then type :q! and hit Enter. To save changes, hit Esc and then type :wq and hit Enter.\n\nGo ahead and click Merge pull request, and wait until you see a screen shortly after that says the Pull request was successfully merged and closed!\n\n\n\n\nfetch and pull\nNow that Jo has completed the first part of the team task, we want to move to the second task, which is cleaning the data. Thankfully Mo is great at data visualization, and has a script that will clean up the code and visualize it for us. But first, Mo needs to pull the changes that Jo just merged into the main repository. There are two approaches to this. One is to use a git fetch, the other is a git pull. The main difference between the two:\nfetch: The safe version, because it downloads any remote content from the repository, but does not update your local repository state. It just keeps a copy of the remote content, leaving any current work intact. To fully integrate the new content, we need to follow a fetch by a merge.\npull: This downloads the remote content and then immediately merges the content with your local state, but if you have pending work, this will create something called a merge conflict, but not to worry, these can be fixed!7.\nMo needs to pull changes in to his branch from main and proceed with the task. Here we assume Jo has already completed work on her branch to download data and clean and transform the data.\n\n\n\n\nYou Try!\n\nTake the following code from Mo and:\npull changes into the repository so everything is up-to-date!\ncreate a unique branch: mo_cleanviz\nsave this code to a new script at code/02_clean_visualize.R\nstage it (either through the Git tab, or via git add),\ncommit (add a message!),\npush to Mo’s branch\nFinish by adding a Pull Request and merging back to main!\n\nAnswers!\n\nNow we have a commit history that might look something like this.\n\n\n\nWhat is one explanation for commit 4? We also have a project that is very easy to re-run and update, and it can be updated or integrated into a parameterized Rmarkdown report which could be shared and updated easily.\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing the loop\nWe’ve reviewed how to create branches, add and revise files, and then commit and push these changes to a shared repository for collaborative projects. Importantly, it’s best practice to always pull/fetch at the beginning of each work session so you have the most-up-to-date changes. And if something needs to be fixed, you can always pull a specific branch and make a change and pull request for that branch before pull requesting and merging back to the main.\nFor example, if Jo needed to make a quick fix to some data analysis, she could pull Mo’s branch, make a fix (commit 4), and merge that back into the same branch before he finalizes the analysis and merges back to the main branch.\n\n\n\nThis is a simplified workflow, but it is very powerful. There are additional options within this workflow, like reverting to previous versions, pruning branches or git history, and more, but the core steps to successfully using version control rely on the material covered above, and practice!\n\nAdditional Git Details\nAlthough there are many more details important to learning version control, many come with more practice and expertise. However, a few important tidbits:\nWhen working on Github, there are options for private and public repositories. private repos are only visible to you and any collaborators you’ve added to your repo. Certain accounts permit unlimited private repos.\n.gitignore: We can access or create this file with the usethis::edit_git_ignore() function. Any file extension or specific file we include in our .gitignore file will mean git ignores it. This is helpful for hidden files or temporary files that may change a lot (i.e., *.html) but aren’t necessary to version contol. You can even ignore entire directories or large files ( >= 100MB). Github is designed to version control scripts, not large amounts of data.\nAdditionally you can use the usethis::git_vaccinate() function to ensure there are no issues or secure files that may get accidentally added to your version control repository.\nLarge files…Github is great, but less ideal for large files. Github will complain with any file over about ~50MB, and anything greater than 100MB requires git-lfs (large file sizes), but it is still unwieldy. See this article for suggestions and options.\n\nResources & Tutorials\nhttps://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/\nhttps://learngitbranching.js.org\nR for excel with github\n“Excuse me do you have a moment to talk version control?” by Jenny Bryan\nGithub for project management\n\n\nPrevious module: Project Management Next module: Interactive Visualization\n\nGithub is not the only site that integrates with git to provide cloud-based version control. Other notable examples include Gitlab and Bitbucket. In this module, we will focus on Github, although the underlying git commands you will learn are extensible to other git-based repositories.↩︎\nGit xkcd↩︎\nIf you ever need to edit your global/git profile, you can use a situation report, usethis::git_sitrep() to see what settings exist and how to diagnose problems.↩︎\nsee this excellent overview of the various ways to create/link an RStudio project with a Github repository↩︎\nIt’s a good idea to store all your github repositories in one place (e.g., ~/Documents/Github). We recommend to avoid nesting git/RStudio projects inside other git/RStudio projects–this can create confusion and make it difficult to properly version control different projects. Each project should have its own repository (e.g., ~/Documents/Github/project_01, ~/Documents/Github/project_02).↩︎\nIn more complex workflows, we can pull branches into other branches before pulling them into the main branch. In the module, we will use more simplified examples, but just remember that there are many other ways to branch and merge.↩︎\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github↩︎\n",
