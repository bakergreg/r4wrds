Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. This workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of R. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., .csv, .xlsx, .shp) used in analysis, and provide resources for additional learning.\n\nWorkshop Overview\nWe will follow the SFS Code of Conduct throughout our workshop.\n\nSource content\nAll source materials for this website can be accessed at [final GH location, perhaps CAOpenWater/wrds].\n\nAttribution\nContent in these lessons has been modified and/or adapted from Data Carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data, the USGS-R training curriculum here, the NCEAS Open Science for Synthesis workshop here, Mapping in R, and the wonderful text R for data science.\nsite last updated: 2021-04-12 12:37\n\n\n\n",
