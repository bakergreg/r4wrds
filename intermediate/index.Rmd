## Who is this course for?

What makes an *Intermediate user*? This course is likely most relevant and targeted at folks who:

 - Took the [Introductory R4WRDS](https://r4wrds.com/intro/) course
 - Are existing R users who want improve their efficiency and skill set
 - Have a general understanding and proficiency in using {dplyr}, {ggplot2}, {sf}, and {rmarkdown}
 - Understand (and use) general best practices for data science in R

## What will you learn?

In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant is working on more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. We have developed each module to function as a "stand-alone" story, so while different modules will focus on different skill sets, in the intermediate course each module doesn't necessarily require the previous module.

**This course focuses on:**

 - more advanced scripting skills like iteration, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency.
 - Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data
 - Pulling water resources data and specific visualization tasks associated with those data
 - Integrating version control in projects with git

<br>

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

## Workshop Overview

We will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.
